# Eq-tex2png

The utility converts Latex-snippets to PNG-images. It processes all the files in a given directory, where each file contains bare Latex-code (without need for any preamble or environment definitions). The way to call the utility is as follows.
```
. path/to/eq-tex2png/compile path/to/equations-directory
```
This creates the PNG-images in the directory where it is executed.
